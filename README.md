# OAK Keboard
This keyboard is under development and currently in the testing phase of the first design.
The layout and PCB design are made with ergogen with the routing and final PCB design done in KiCAD

## Reasons of Develpment
Most compact split keyboards choose to either drop the number row and keep a very minimal key count or include many keys on each row. I wanted something that includes the number row but still keeps a very minimal approch to keyboards that won't require users to move their hands much. Its hard to find a board that fully much both your personal keycount requirements and general hand size. This 27 per hand key count I provide is something that I feel missing from the market and while the first version is developed for my mid to large size hand I'll be able to include a version with lower stagger in the future quite easily.

## Goals
* Revisable board split keyboard.
* Include a number row.
* Fit my hand stagger.
* Horizontal line stagger for pinky.

## Current Development
I'm currently working on producing OAK v0.1. A keyboard powered by two promicroes connected via a TRRS cable. To make the board easy to build it does not supprt N key rollover. This is generaly fine for all users and it reduces the diode count from 27 to 7.

## Roadmap
I would like to make a few improvements to the boards in the future and they are as follow:
|Version|Features|
|---|---|
|V1.0|Final look for the board. Round off the top and line up the buttom. Make the board ready for production with a case.|
|V1.1|Support SMD cotex M0 processor for slicker design and no diodes.|
|V1.0s|A smaller stagger for the keys for users with smaller hands|
